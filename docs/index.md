# Docker Volume Backups With Safer Restores

VolumeVault is a self-hosted Laravel application for managing Docker volume backups and safe restores to storage backends supported by [`offen/docker-volume-backup`](https://github.com/offen/docker-volume-backup).

It provides a guided web UI around scheduled backups, encrypted destinations, notifications, restore runs, run history, onboarding, and API-driven automation while keeping operational risks explicit.

## Highlights

- Discover Docker volumes through the Docker CLI and keep missing volumes visible only while backup jobs still reference them.
- Review backup coverage by volume or Docker Compose/Swarm stack, including the latest known backup size when available.
- Configure AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, custom S3-compatible storage, WebDAV, SSH/SFTP, Azure Blob Storage, Dropbox, Google Drive, and local filesystem destinations.
- Store destination credentials and notification URLs encrypted at rest with Laravel `Crypt`.
- Create hourly, daily, weekly, or cron-based backup schedules.
- Run manual backups, pause or resume jobs, inspect logs, and view backup and restore history.
- Restore selected archives into new Docker volumes by default.
- Configure Shoutrrr notification channels globally or per backup job, with backup size available in messages when it is known.
- Create API tokens for integrations, automation scripts, dashboards, and AI agents.
- Export encrypted installation saves and import them during onboarding.

## Quick Start

Generate an application key first:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/darkdragon14/volumevault:latest php artisan key:generate --show
```

Paste the generated key into the recommended Compose file from the installation guide, then start VolumeVault:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`, then create the first administrator account from onboarding or import an existing installation save.

## Security Warning

Mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` gives VolumeVault high privileges on the Docker host. Only run it in a trusted environment, and treat access to the web UI and write-capable API tokens like access to the Docker host.

## Credits

VolumeVault relies on [`offen/docker-volume-backup`](https://github.com/offen/docker-volume-backup) for the actual Docker volume backup engine and destination support.

Huge thanks to Offen and the maintainers of `offen/docker-volume-backup` for their work. VolumeVault exists as an orchestration and management UI around that project, not as a replacement for it.
